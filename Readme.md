Open a terminal window by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.

Update the package list by running the command sudo apt update.

Install the PostgreSQL package by running the command ```sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib```.

After the installation is complete, you can check the version of PostgreSQL by running the command ```psql --version```.

To start the PostgreSQL service, run the command ```sudo systemctl start postgresql```

To check the status of the PostgreSQL service, run the command ```sudo systemctl status postgresql```

To configure the PostgreSQL service to start automatically at boot time, run the command ```sudo systemctl enable postgresql```

Once you've completed these steps, PostgreSQL should be successfully installed and running on your Ubuntu 22.04.1 system.

# pgAdmin4
If you want to use a graphical user interface (GUI) to manage your PostgreSQL database on Ubuntu 22.04.1, you can use a tool called pgAdmin.

To install pgAdmin on Ubuntu 22.04.1, you can use the following steps:

Open a terminal window by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.

Update the package list by running the command ```sudo apt update```.

Install pgAdmin by running the command ```sudo apt install pgadmin4```.

After the installation is complete, you can start pgAdmin by running the command pgadmin4

Once pgAdmin is running, you can connect to your PostgreSQL server by providing the necessary connection details, such as the server name, port number, username, and password.

You can also use other **GUI** tools like **DBeaver, DataGrip, SQL Workbench/J, and Navicat**. It's a matter of preference.

Please note that in some cases, you may need to configure pgAdmin to work with PostgreSQL, so you may need to refer to the pgAdmin documentation or seek help from the pgAdmin community.
